# VOTO

This stands for (Voll gewesen, toll gewesen / it was full, it was
great), and is a website to document the history of berlin nightlife
since the fall of the wall.


## Status

It's just a basic prototype for now that displays a map on the start
page with a time slider, and shows clubs as markers.

Demo: http://votoproto.herokuapp.com/

If you can read the code then you know how to add clubs ;-).
